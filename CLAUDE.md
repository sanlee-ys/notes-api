## Links — verify before sending (hard rule)

Added 2026-07-04 after repeated 404s from links given in chat. Any clickable
reference given to the user must actually resolve:

1. **Full URLs only.** Point at files with the complete
   `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path>` URL — never a
   local-clone path like `<repo-folder>/materials/foo.md`, whose leading
   repo-folder segment doubles when pasted after a GitHub branch URL and 404s.
2. **Verify before sending.** Confirm the exact path exists on the exact ref
   before linking (e.g. GitHub MCP `get_file_contents`, or `git ls-tree
   origin/<branch> -- <path>` after a confirmed push). Unverified links do not
   get sent — say "unverified" instead.
3. **Branch links are perishable.** A `blob/<feature-branch>` URL dies when the
   branch merges and is deleted. Flag branch-scoped links as such; prefer
   `main` URLs once the work has merged.

If a link 404s, the failure mode was here — fix the process, not just the link.
